### Motivation

- Although there are some accordion plugins, there aren't so many that offers a nested structure of any number of levels.
- Existing accordions are usually hard to customize because they come with their own styling configuration.

The above reasons led me to build an extremely customizable recursive accordion.

### Installation

First install package by npm

> npm i vue-multilevel-accordion

Then import the component and register it where you want to use it.

```
<script>
import MultilevelAccordion from "vue-multilevel-accordion";

export default {
  components: {
    MultilevelAccordion
  }
};
</script>
```

### Use

### Demo

a) Simple Accordion

b) Nested Menu
